# Regex_Guide

In this guide to Regex or (regular expressions) , we will be taking a brief look into what these expressions are and how they work. While regular expressions may seem to be overwhelming at first glance, just like with any language in programming, they can be broken down into much easier to understand parts and pieces.

## Summary

Regex (short for regular expression) is a string of text that allows you to create search patterns that match, manage, and locate text. An example code snippet of regex shows as following:
```
/[\w._%+-]+@[\w.-]+\.[a-zA-z]{2,4}/
```
* A regular expression used to match an e-mail address

Regular expressions can also be used from the command line and within text-editors to find text within a file.
